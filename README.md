How ignite/shutdown NetCore host applications

I created this repo in order to learn all the stuff included behind the scenes that help developers to create Console, Web and Service apps in a proper way.

The below points are interesting:

..* ..Net projects SDK (Microsoft Docs)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview]
...Each project SDK is a set of MSBuild targets and associated tasks that are responsible for compiling, packing, and publishing code.
...Available SDKs: Microsoft.NET.Sdk, Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web, Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker, etc
...
...```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  ...
</Project>
```
...
..* .Net Generic Host (Microsoft Docs)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host]
...A host is an object that encapsulates an app's resources, such as:
...
...1. Dependency injection (DI)
...2.Logging
...3.Configuration
...4.IHostedService implementations
...
...The main reason for including all of the app's interdependent resources in one object is lifetime management: control over app startup and graceful shutdown. This is achieved with the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting NuGet package.
...
..* Running Console, WebApps using the same DI container
